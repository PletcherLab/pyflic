    "## Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook begins a series of notebooks that contain working examples intended to make it easier to understand how we analyze the signal data from FLIC DFMs.  This Python implementation (`pyflic`) is a full port of the original R code, with an object-oriented design centred on the **`Experiment`** class as the primary interface.\n",
    "\n",
    "We have written functions that cover simple feeding experiments (one feeding well per chamber) and choice experiments (two feeding wells per chamber).  These notebooks currently serve as the primary documentation.  The source code is commented and available from GitHub.  Example data files are included in the repository under `python_test_data/`.\n",
    "\n",
    "As with all FLIC code this is a work in progress.  If you decide to extend the code and wish to share it with the community, please contact [Scott](mailto:spletch@umich.edu)."

    "1. **Load raw data** from the relevant CSV file(s).  Multi-segment experiments (files named `DFM_N_0.csv`, `DFM_N_1.csv`, …) are stitched together automatically.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Calculate elapsed time** using date/time columns to produce a `Minutes` column for each observation.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Baseline normalisation.** A running median is applied to each well's signal with a window defined by `baseline_window_minutes` (default 3 min, i.e. 900 samples at 5 Hz).  The assumption is that feeding interactions in any 3-minute window will be sufficiently rare that the median represents background signal.  The baselined signal is the raw signal minus this running-median baseline.  This corrects for inter-DFM signal variation and for slow drifts (e.g. from over-filled food wells).\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Identify feeding licks and events.**  An observation is classified as a feeding lick if:\n",
    "   - it exceeds `feeding_threshold`, **or**\n",
    "   - it exceeds `feeding_minimum` and is adjacent to at least one sample that exceeds `feeding_threshold`.\n",
    "   \n",
    "   A contiguous run of licks forms a candidate *event*.  The event is retained only if the number of licks meets or exceeds `feeding_minevents`.  Adjacent events separated by less than `feeding_event_link_gap` seconds of inactivity are merged into a single event.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **WellA / WellB assignment (two-well experiments).**  The `pi_direction` parameter maps physical well positions to the logical WellA/WellB labels used in all output.  `pi_direction=\"left\"` makes the left well WellA (PI multiplier = +1 in the R code); `\"right\"` reverses this.  Swapping `pi_direction` across DFMs while counterbalancing food positions ensures that a positive PI always indicates preference for WellA regardless of its physical location.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Identify tasting licks.**  Signals that fall between `tasting_minimum` and `tasting_maximum` and were *not* already classified as feeding licks are labelled tasting licks.  Contiguous runs are grouped into tasting events subject to `tasting_minevents`.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. **Compute PI (two-well experiments).**  At each sample a PI of +1, −1, or 0 is recorded depending on whether WellA, WellB, or neither registered a feeding lick.\n",
    "\n",
    "8. **Compute durations and intervals.**  The duration (seconds) of each feeding/tasting event and the inter-event interval are stored for downstream analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "9. **Lights.**  If the DFM CSV contains `OptoCol1` (and optionally `OptoCol2`) columns, the per-well light state is decoded from the bit-encoded values and stored in `lights_df`.  This is used to place light-on markers on cumulative lick plots.\n",
